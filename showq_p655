## This script exists because none of the tools on
## datastar (LoadLeveler or Catalina) hold information
## to clasify the available queues into P655 and/or P690 

## This script also should provide the same options
## and interface as provided by the production showq
## script on DataStar, so pass in any arguments given
## by the user and set the queue names to P655 queues.

## Time sensitive note : this script might require 
## an update if the names of the P655 queues change
