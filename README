# Someone needs to set this up for autoconf and automake
# Only supports LoadL or PBS or SLURM, for now.
Prerequisites:

1.  LoadLeveler v2.2 or OpenPBS or SLURM 2.0+

1a. If LoadLeveler, then PyLoadL is also required.  Download
    from http://www.gingergeeks.co.uk/ and install.

1b. If SLURM:
    - Dependencies and BlueGene geometries are not currently supported.
    - Specify Procs and RealMemory in Compute Nodes section of
      etc/slurm.conf, for shared nodes:
NodeName=node[1-2] Procs=1 State=UNKNOWN RealMemory=460 Feature=compute,CPU1
    - Specify the Wiki interface in etc/slurm.conf:
#SchedulerType=sched/backfill
SchedulerType=sched/wiki
SchedulerPort=7321
    - Specify an auth key in etc/wiki.conf
AuthKey=3857

    Using sched/wiki will put jobs in Priority 0, JobHeld on submit.
    Catalina will run jobs by setting Priority 1, through scontrol.
    Since Catalina uses scontrol to start jobs, the SchedulerPort
    and AuthKey are not actually used.

 1b. If OpenPBS/Torque:
    - http://www.clusterresources.com/products/mwm/docs/pbsintegration.shtml
    - qmgr -c 'set server keep_completed = 300'
    - qmgr -c 'set server scheduling=True'
    - make sure pbs_sched daemon does not start
    - disable the qalter command
    - for matching jobs to nodes correctly, create a submit filter
      that adds node properties to the resources (-l) line of
      the job script.

2. Python v2.4.1+

To extract dist.tar:
cd <temp dir>
tar xf <path to dist.tar file>
cd catalina

There are two ways to setup Catalina. 
A. Interactive setup
B. Manual setup

A is recommended. 


A. Interactive setup
====================


1.  Execute configure.sh with no argument
    ./configure.sh

	<an interactive script will run asking for the following config >
*****************************************************************
# PBS or LL
export RESOURCEMANAGER=PBS
# Resource manager library path
export CATALINA_RMLIBDIRS=-L/usr/local/lib
# Resource manager include path
export CATALINA_RMINCDIRS=-I/usr/local/include
# owner of Catalina files
export CATALINA_CATOWNER=kenneth
# group of Catalina files
export CATALINA_CATLOCKGROUP=ops100
# directory in which to place man pages
export CATALINA_MANPATH=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/man
# directory in which to install executables
export CATALINA_INSTALLDIR=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/install
# directory in which to store database files
export CATALINA_DBDIR=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/db
# directory in which to store archived logs
export CATALINA_ARCHIVEDIR=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/archive
# C compiler
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
# Python interpreter
export CATALINA_PYTHONPATH=/paci/loadl/diag/python152/bin/python
# permissions for user-settable reservation commands
export CATALINA_CATUSERPERMS=2755
# default job class or queue
export CATALINA_DEFAULT_JOB_CLASS=standard
# If LL, location of LoadLeveler admin file
export CATALINA_LOADL_ADMIN_FILE=/paci/loadl/LoadL_admin.AIX5L
# If PBS, name of host from which jobs will be submitted and reservations set
# If desired, this can be set to IGNORE.  In that case, Catalina will not
# consider the <@hostname> part of the jobowner field.  All users will be
# considered equivalent, regardless of host.
#export CATALINA_PBS_SUBMITHOST=ctf01
export CATALINA_PBS_SUBMITHOST=IGNORE
******************************************************************* 

Note:
  optionally the user can tell this script to dump the settings to a file
  this is recommended. With this source file, you don't have to restart
  configuration from the beginning if the install fail in any case
 
Note :
  This script will set the necessary environment variables, run
  conf.sh ; make ; make install at the user prompt.

Note :
  If the install fails for any reason, you have to source the settings.sh
  file and retry the command that failed after taking corrective actions. 
  Alternatively you can restart from step 1.


B. Manual setup
=====================

1. Manually set these environment variables.

# PBS or LL
export RESOURCEMANAGER=PBS
# Resource manager library path
export CATALINA_RMLIBDIRS=-L/usr/local/lib
# Resource manager include path
export CATALINA_RMINCDIRS=-I/usr/local/include
# owner of Catalina files
export CATALINA_CATOWNER=kenneth
# group of Catalina files
export CATALINA_CATLOCKGROUP=ops100
# directory in which to place man pages
export CATALINA_MANPATH=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/man
# directory in which to install executables
export CATALINA_INSTALLDIR=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/install
# directory in which to store database files
export CATALINA_DBDIR=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/db
# directory in which to store archived logs
export CATALINA_ARCHIVEDIR=/home/sdsc/kenneth/catalina/archive
# C compiler
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
# Python interpreter
export CATALINA_PYTHONPATH=/paci/loadl/diag/python152/bin/python
# permissions for user-settable reservation commands
export CATALINA_CATUSERPERMS=2755
# default job class or queue
export CATALINA_DEFAULT_JOB_CLASS=standard
# If LL, location of LoadLeveler admin file
export CATALINA_LOADL_ADMIN_FILE=/paci/loadl/LoadL_admin.AIX5L
# If PBS, name of host from which jobs will be submitted and reservations set
# If desired, this can be set to IGNORE.  In that case, Catalina will not
# consider the <@hostname> part of the jobowner field.  All users will be
# considered equivalent, regardless of host.
#export CATALINA_PBS_SUBMITHOST=ctf01


2. Run conf.sh

./conf.sh

Many other environment variables are available to customize the install.
Check the conf.sh script for these.

3.  Run
make

4.  Run
make install

At first install: 

5. Run
make config

6. Copy catalina.config to install directory.
(It's not done by make install, so that existing config files are preserved in
upgrades)
cp catalina.config <install directory>

7.  Initialize databases.  This will wipe out any existing databases.
cd <install directory>
./intialize_dbs

8.  Run tests.  This will also wipe out any existing databases.
./scratchtest.py

To upgrade:

1. Follow steps 1-4 of 'To set up:'

2. Integrate config file changes.
cd <build directory>
diff catalina.config <install directory>/catalina.config

Reconcile any differences.

Notes:

- To modify Catalina behaviour at build time, check the conf.sh file for
  environment variables that may be used to change default values in the
  Makefile or catalina.config file.
